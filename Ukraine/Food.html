                    Although there are debates about its origin, many historians agree that Chicken Kyiv has strong connections to Ukrainian
                    culinary tradition. It gained fame when it was served at the Continental Hotel in Kyiv in the early 20th century. In
                    Soviet times, the dish became popular in international restaurants as a symbol of Ukrainian cuisine. Foreign guests
                    visiting Kyiv often ordered it as a “signature” dish.
