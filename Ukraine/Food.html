                    <p>Holubtsi are cabbage rolls filled with a mixture of rice and minced meat, sometimes barley or mushrooms. They are
                    wrapped in boiled cabbage leaves and simmered in tomato sauce or sour cream.
                    <br>
                    Historical background:
                    The dish has roots in Eastern Europe and became especially popular in Ukraine in the 18th and 19th centuries.
                    Traditionally, holubtsi were prepared for Christmas, weddings, and family celebrations. In rural Ukraine, they were a
                    sign of prosperity because cabbage and grains were widely available. The name “holubtsi” (literally “little pigeons”)
                    likely came from a similar dish in Turkey that used pigeon meat.

                    <h1>Chicken Kyiv</h1>
                    <p>Chicken Kyiv is a well-known Ukrainian dish consisting of chicken breast filled with cold herb and garlic butter, then
                    rolled, breaded, and fried until crispy. When cut open, the melted butter flows out, creating a dramatic presentation.
                    <br>
                    Historical background:
                    Although there are debates about its origin, many historians agree that Chicken Kyiv has strong connections to Ukrainian
                    culinary tradition. It gained fame when it was served at the Continental Hotel in Kyiv in the early 20th century. In
                    Soviet times, the dish became popular in international restaurants as a symbol of Ukrainian cuisine. Foreign guests
                    visiting Kyiv often ordered it as a “signature” dish.
