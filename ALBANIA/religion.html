    <h1>Religion</h1>

    <p>
        Albania is known for its unusually high level of religious tolerance and secularism. 
        After centuries of diverse religious influences and a period of enforced state atheism, 
        contemporary Albania is characterized more by cultural identity than by strict religious practice.
        Majority of the Albanian population are Muslims (50–65%), this is due to being part of the Ottoman empire. 
        Islam was influenced which resulted in Albania turning into a majority Muslim country. However, Albania is quite 
        diverse when it comes to religion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although not everyone is continuously practicing religion due to communism, the people were forced to give up 
        their religions and were forced to strictly follow Enver Hoxha's laws during the communist times. However, 
        Albanians choose to prioritise culture over religion — no matter the faith, they follow the culture and 
        traditions of their ancestors rather than split into groups based on religion.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Main religious communities:</strong><br><br>
        - Islam — generally considered the largest group.<br>
        - Roman Catholics — concentrated primarily in the north.<br>
        - Eastern Orthodox Christians — centered in the south.<br>
