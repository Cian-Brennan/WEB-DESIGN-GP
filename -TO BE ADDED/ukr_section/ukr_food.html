                    <h1>Borshch</h1>
                    <p>Borshch is one of the most iconic and symbolic Ukrainian dishes. It is a hearty beet soup made with beets, cabbage,
                    potatoes, carrots, onions, tomatoes, and sometimes beans or meat. The deep red color comes from beets. It is
                    traditionally served with sour cream and sprinkled with fresh dill or garlic.
                    <br>
                    Historical background:
                    Borshch has been cooked in Ukraine for centuries—historical records mention variations of the dish as early as the 14th
                    century. It became a national symbol of Ukrainian hospitality and family gatherings. Every region has its own version,
                    and even the same family might have a recipe “from grandma.” In 2022, UNESCO officially recognized Ukrainian borshch as
                    part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Ukraine, highlighting its cultural meaning and importance.</p>

                    <h1>Varenyky</h1>
                    <p>Varenyky are traditional Ukrainian dumplings, made from soft dough and filled with various ingredients such as mashed
                    potatoes, cottage cheese, cherries, cabbage, or minced meat. They are boiled and often served with sour cream, fried
                    onions, or butter. Sweet varenyky with cherries are especially popular in summer.
                    <br>
                    Historical background:
                    Varenyky have deep roots in Ukrainian culture. Historically, they were prepared for holidays, weddings, and harvest
                    celebrations. In pagan times, they symbolized the moon due to their crescent shape. They are mentioned in old Ukrainian
                    songs and poetry, and they have become a national symbol representing comfort and home-style cooking.</p>

                    <h1>Holubtsi</h1>
                    <p>Holubtsi are cabbage rolls filled with a mixture of rice and minced meat, sometimes barley or mushrooms. They are
                    wrapped in boiled cabbage leaves and simmered in tomato sauce or sour cream.
                    <br>
                    Historical background:
                    The dish has roots in Eastern Europe and became especially popular in Ukraine in the 18th and 19th centuries.
                    Traditionally, holubtsi were prepared for Christmas, weddings, and family celebrations. In rural Ukraine, they were a
                    sign of prosperity because cabbage and grains were widely available. The name “holubtsi” (literally “little pigeons”)
                    likely came from a similar dish in Turkey that used pigeon meat.

                    <h1>Chicken Kyiv</h1>
                    <p>Chicken Kyiv is a well-known Ukrainian dish consisting of chicken breast filled with cold herb and garlic butter, then
                    rolled, breaded, and fried until crispy. When cut open, the melted butter flows out, creating a dramatic presentation.
                    <br>
                    Historical background:
                    Although there are debates about its origin, many historians agree that Chicken Kyiv has strong connections to Ukrainian
                    culinary tradition. It gained fame when it was served at the Continental Hotel in Kyiv in the early 20th century. In
                    Soviet times, the dish became popular in international restaurants as a symbol of Ukrainian cuisine. Foreign guests
                    visiting Kyiv often ordered it as a “signature” dish.
