                        <p>Chuck Palahniuk is an American novelist and journalist, best known as the author of <i>Fight Club</i>.</p>
                        <p>He was born in 1962 in Washington State, USA, to a family of Ukrainian immigrants — his grandparents emigrated from
                        Ukraine. Palahniuk has mentioned his Eastern European roots in several interviews.
                        
                        He is famous for his dark, satirical, and psychologically deep writing style, often exploring themes of identity,
                        consumerism, and rebellion.</p>

                    <div class="fam_des">
                        <p class="andy">Andy Warhol was an American artist, designer, and producer, and one of the most famous figures in the Pop
                        Art movement.
                        
                        He was born in 1928 in Pittsburgh, USA, to a family of Ukrainian immigrants from the village of Miková (now in Slovakia, but
                        historically inhabited by Rusyns — an ethnic Ukrainian group). His original name was Andrew Warhola.
                        
                        Warhol became famous for his works depicting mass culture and celebrities — such as portraits of Marilyn Monroe,
                        Campbell’s soup cans, and Coca-Cola bottles. He blurred the line between art and commerce, making art accessible to
                        everyone.
                        
                        His influence is enormous — Warhol redefined the idea of the artist as a brand and became a lasting symbol of modern
                        visual culture.</p>

                        <p class="usyk">Oleksandr Usyk is a Ukrainian professional boxer and one of the most accomplished
                        fighters of his generation.
                        
                        He was born in 1987 in Simferopol, Crimea, and began his career as an amateur, winning Olympic gold in 2012 for Ukraine.
                        Usyk became famous for his incredible footwork, strategy, and discipline.
                        
                        As a professional, he became the undisputed cruiserweight world champion — holding all major titles (WBA, WBC, IBF,
                        and WBO) — and later moved up to heavyweight, where he defeated Anthony Joshua to become world heavyweight
                        champion.
                        
                        Beyond boxing, Usyk is known for his patriotism, humility, and strong representation of Ukrainian spirit on the global
                        stage.

                        <p class="spiel">Steven Spielberg is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter, widely
                        regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers in history.
                        
                        He was born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to a Jewish family of Ukrainian descent — his paternal grandparents emigrated from
                        Ukraine.
                        
                        Spielberg is famous for directing legendary films such as Jaws, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic Park,
                        Indiana Jones, Schindler’s List, and Saving Private Ryan. His movies often combine emotional storytelling
                        with groundbreaking special effects.
                        
                        He has won multiple Academy Awards and helped shape modern cinema, inspiring generations of filmmakers around the
                        world.

                        <p class="taras">Taras Shevchenko was a Ukrainian poet, writer, artist, and national hero, often called the father
                        of Ukrainian literature.
                        
                        He was born in 1814 into a poor serf family in the Kyiv region but was later freed thanks to his artistic talent. Shevchenko’s
                        poetry, especially his famous collection “Kobzar”, expressed deep love for Ukraine, its people, and the struggle for
                        freedom.
                        
                        Beyond writing, he was also a talented painter and illustrator. His works inspired generations of Ukrainians to preserve
                        their language, culture, and national identity.
                        
                        Today, Taras Shevchenko remains one of the most important cultural figures in Ukraine’s history — a symbol of freedom
                        and Ukrainian spirit.
