                    <h1>Origins in Kyivan Rus (9th–13th century)</h1>
                    <p>The history of Ukraine begins with Kyivan Rus — a medieval state founded by the Eastern Slavs with Kyiv as its political
                    and cultural center. By the 10th and 11th centuries, Kyivan Rus was one of the most influential states in Europe, known
                    for its trade networks, diplomacy, and rich culture. The adoption of Christianity in 988 by Prince Volodymyr the Great
                    connected Kyivan Rus to European traditions and shaped the spiritual and cultural identity of Ukrainians. Many modern
                    Eastern European nations trace their heritage to Kyivan Rus, but Ukraine sees Kyiv as the center of this tradition.

                    <h1>Foreign domination and cultural resilience (13th–18th century)</h1>
                    <p>After the Mongol invasion in the 13th century destroyed Kyiv’s power, Ukrainian lands became divided between major
                    neighboring powers. Western parts were absorbed by the Kingdom of Poland and later the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth,
                    while eastern lands gradually came under the influence of the rising Muscovite state. Later, parts of Ukraine also fell
                    under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
                    Despite this fragmentation, Ukrainian culture remained strong. Folk traditions, language, and literature developed in
                    rural communities, churches, and academies. Ukrainian peasants kept national customs alive, and cities like Lviv, Kyiv,
                    and Chernihiv became centers of learning. The Ukrainian Baroque period produced unique architecture and literature that
                    survive to this day.

                    <h1>The rise of the Cossacks and the struggle for autonomy (17th–18th century)</h1>
                    <p>In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Ukrainian Cossacks emerged as a powerful social and military group. They lived on
                    the Dnipro River, trained as skilled fighters, and fought to defend Ukrainian lands from foreign domination. Under
                    Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the Cossack Hetmanate was established after the uprising of 1648.
                    This state had its own government, army, diplomacy, and legal system. It represented one of the first major attempts at
                    Ukrainian self-rule. Although alliances with neighboring powers (including the Treaty of Pereyaslav with Moscow)
                    eventually led to loss of autonomy, the Cossack era remains a symbol of Ukrainian independence, freedom, and identity.

                    <h1>19th–20th centuries: National revival, independence attempts, Soviet era, and modern statehood</h1>
                    <p>The 19th century saw a strong Ukrainian cultural revival. Writers, poets, and intellectuals like Taras Shevchenko, Ivan
                    Franko, and Lesya Ukrainka fueled national consciousness through literature and political activism. Ukrainians began
                    organizing political movements and demanding rights.
                    After World War I, Ukraine briefly declared independence in 1918–1920 but was overwhelmed by civil war and absorbed into
                    the Soviet Union.
                    Under Soviet rule, Ukraine suffered greatly:
                    <br>
                        <span class="red_l">- Holodomor (1932–33): a man-made famine that killed millions.</span>          
                    <br>
                        <span class="red_l">- Political repressions targeting Ukrainian intellectuals.</span>
                    <br>
                        <span class="red_l">- World War II, during which Ukraine became one of the main battlefields.</span>
                    <br>
                    However, Ukraine played a significant role in the USSR’s economy, science, and military power. In 1991, after the
                    collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine voted overwhelmingly for independence and became a sovereign nation.
                    In the 21st century, democratic movements — the Orange Revolution (2004) and the Revolution of Dignity (2013–14) —
                    pushed Ukraine toward Europe, independence from Russian influence, and stronger civil society.

                    <h1>Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine (2022–present)</h1>
                    <p>On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine — one of the largest military attacks in Europe
                    since World War II. Ukrainian cities, infrastructure, and civilian areas were heavily bombed. Millions of Ukrainians
                    became refugees. Despite overwhelming force, Ukraine defended Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, and other key cities.
                    The war strengthened Ukrainian unity and gained massive international support. Ukrainian Armed Forces, with modern
                    tactics and global assistance, liberated many territories and continue to defend the country.
                    Ukraine’s struggle is now central to global politics, symbolizing the fight for democracy, freedom, and national
                    sovereignty. The war significantly accelerated Ukraine’s integration with Europe and its identity as an independent
                    nation.
