                    <h1>Monument to Taras Shevchenko in Kharkiv</h1>
                    <p>The Monument to Taras Shevchenko in Kharkiv is one of the most impressive and iconic statues of Ukraine’s national poet.
                    It was unveiled in 1935 and designed by sculptor Matvei Manizer. The monument consists of a central statue of Shevchenko
                    surrounded by expressive sculptural figures representing characters from his poems and symbolic scenes from Ukrainian
                    history and folklore. It stands in Shevchenko Garden near the university and is considered one of the finest examples of
                    monumental Soviet-era sculpture dedicated to a Ukrainian cultural figure.

                    <p>This monument is dedicated to the legendary founders of Kyiv — three brothers (Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv) and their sister
                    Lybid. It is located on the banks of the Dnipro River and was completed in 1982. The sculpture shows the siblings
                    standing on a boat, symbolizing the origins of the ancient settlement that became the capital of Kyivan Rus’. The
                    monument has become a beloved symbol of Kyiv’s mythology and rich historical heritage.
